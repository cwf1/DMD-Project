FreeSound and ToneJS project


This is a project using FreeSound and Tonejs API's for DMD-3035(Scripting For The Web) course at UConn Stamford.

This website uitlizes FreeSound API to search for, listen to and download sounds. ToneJs provides a grain player that allows for mainpulation of a sound in a few different capacities. 

The idea behind the project is to combine the two API's into one website and eventually web application with many more features.

Currently sounds can be searched for, downloaded and loaded into the ToneJs grain player for manipulation. The only requirement is to have a FreeSound account which users will be prompted to make when visiting the site which is hosted on github pages( link at bottom.)

The UI was improved by Stephen Rozo and Emily Serven who are Collaborators on the project.

This is still a work in progress.
