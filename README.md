FreeSound and ToneJS project

To get this to run a localserver will have to be deployed and the port needs to be 8080 because the callback url where freesound sends the auth codes is localhost:8080

The root folder for the webserver should be the DMD-Project folder that is downloaded from this repo.

UPDATE
This site is now hosted on github pages and if the localserver is used anyway, you will be redirected to the github hosted version unless already logged in.
